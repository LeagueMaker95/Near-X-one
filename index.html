Hello,

Do you like to test an RPG video game?
Well, there are forums and my game: Near X one.(still no finished)
"Link to a forum":http://www.rpg-maker.fr/jeux.html

What if you create one?

The ideal software (in 2D) is "here":https://www.rpgmakerweb.com/languages/fr
Me personally, I went to rpg maker vx ace because it's the easiest to use, we can create
complex systems...etc But still *RPG Maker* has several versions: RPG Maker XP, RPG Maker VX,(which has a slight difference with RPG Maker VX ace) RPG Maker 2003, RPG Maker 2000, RPG Maker 95...etc

Good game development!
