# RPG game development software


Hello,

Do you like to test an RPG video game? Well, there are forums and my game: Near X one.(still not finished)

See on [Oniromancie](http://www.rpg-maker.fr/jeux.html), the famous french RPG Maker forum. 

What if you create one?

The ideal software (in 2D) is [here](https://www.rpgmakerweb.com/languages/fr)

Personally, I've turned to rpg maker vx ace because it's the easiest to use, we can create complex systems...etc

however RPG Maker has several versions: RPG Maker XP, RPG Maker VX, (which has a slight difference with RPG Maker VX ace) RPG Maker 2003, RPG Maker 2000, RPG Maker 95...etc

Good game development!

## Why choose this software?

RPG Maker offers a multitude of possibilities and can be complex if necessary.
Moreover, RPG Maker is the easiest to use.
Many tutorials in any language are available,

## Why would that be interesting?

RPG Maker offers scalable systems such as the A-RPG (real-time combat system).
can quickly become complex and interesting for your game because the basic combat system
is at turn by turn and RPG Maker allows it to do this system. There is eventually
the scripts. The scripts allow you to build your game, you will be able to add, modify, customize etc...
Thus, you will be able to customize your game.
