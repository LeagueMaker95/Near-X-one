# RPG game development software


Hello,

Do you like to test an RPG video game? Well, there are forums and my game: Near X one.(still not finished)

Link to the french forum : Oniromancie

What if you create one?

The ideal software (in 2D) is here

Personally, I've turned to rpg maker vx ace because it's the easiest to use, we can create complex systems...etc

however RPG Maker has several versions: RPG Maker XP, RPG Maker VX, (which has a slight difference with RPG Maker VX ace) RPG Maker 2003, RPG Maker 2000, RPG Maker 95...etc

Good game development!
