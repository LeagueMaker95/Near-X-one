# How to update characters graphic

Hi X-oners !

I'll give you some tips to update characters' graphic.
First of all, I trued to do it with basic softaware like Paint but it's a mess !

So, I decided to use RPG Maker MV engine to do it easily. But my trial version was outdated ! :( 
Fortunately, My dad accepted to buy a licence and I've installed it in my machine 
... 


Enjoy!
