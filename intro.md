Hello,

Do you like to test an RPG video game?
Well, there are forums and my game: Near X one.(still not finished)

[Link to the french forum : Oniromancie](http://www.rpg-maker.fr/jeux.html)

*What if you create one?*

The ideal software (in 2D) is [here](https://www.rpgmakerweb.com)

Personally, I've turned to rpg maker vx ace because it's the easiest to use, we can create complex systems...etc 

however *RPG Maker* has several versions: RPG Maker XP, RPG Maker VX, (which has a slight difference with RPG Maker VX ace) RPG Maker 2003, RPG Maker 2000, RPG Maker 95...etc

*Good game development!*
